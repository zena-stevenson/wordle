# wordle
 A little just-for-funsies project I want to see if I can build a bot (?)
that can play wordle as well as I can (not to brag, but I'm at 100% right now...)

We're going to see how far it can get with a purely statistical approach, ie guessing words based on prev knowledge of the most common letters and letter groups in the english language (https://www.wordcheats.com/blog/most-used-letters-in-english, more sources to be added). The best way to do that analysis is tbd

Current list of 5-letter words downloaded from https://web.archive.org/web/20131118073324/http://www.infochimps.com/datasets/word-list-350000-simple-english-words-excel-readable

or, possibly, from
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwyl/english-words/master/words_alpha.txt

...I did a bad job keeping track.
